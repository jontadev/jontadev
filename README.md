ðŸ‘‹ Hello,

 My name is Jonatan Soares, I'm 26 years old, I have been working for 6 years as Software Developer with Java and today I work and live in Germany. 
 I'm always interested to learn new technologies and new ways to improve my work. :smiley:
 
 Here on Github, you wi'll find some of my projects that I developed oder I'm developing at home to practicing.
 
You can find me also under [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonatan-jos%C3%A9-soares-903a7998/).
